# Week #1

## Project description

### Project name: **Autonomous Semantic 3D Reconstruction and High-Fidelity Mapping**

**Code repository:** https://github.com/Mousatat/Autonomous-Drone-Semantic-3D-Reconstruction-and-High-Fidelity-Mapping

An autonomous UAV-based system designed for semantic 3D spatial reconstruction and high-fidelity mapping. The project integrates real-time semantic segmentation via SpatialLM, autonomous UAV navigation using agentic AI, and precise exploration strategies to efficiently generate detailed digital twins.

---

## Problem Statement

Existing autonomous 3D mapping solutions face limitations in:

- Real-time semantic understanding of environments.
    
- Autonomous optimal exploration decision-making.
    
- Efficient and effective data processing for high-quality spatial reconstructions.
    

Our system addresses these challenges through advanced semantic models, autonomous UAV navigation powered by agentic AI, and two-stage reconstruction techniques for superior spatial accuracy and usability.
