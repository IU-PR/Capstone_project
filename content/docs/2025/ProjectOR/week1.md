# Week #1

## Project description

### Project name: ProjectOR

**Code repository**: https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/ProjectOR

This platform allows creators to post startup ideas, developers to explore and join projects, and teams to collaborate
efficiently. It also features a "startup graveyard" to document failed ventures, providing valuable insights for future
innovators.

## Brainstorming

### Ideas during brainstorming

1. **Project Matchmaking System**
Automatically recommend projects to developers based on skills, interests, and availability.

2. **Skill Badging & Profile Verification**
Allow users to earn badges for specific skills and verify profiles to build trust within the community.

3. **Startup Graveyard with Analytics**
Analyze reasons for project failures (e.g., lack of funding, team issues, market mismatch) to help others avoid common pitfalls.

4. **Idea Validation Tool**
Enable users to vote, comment, and provide feedback on startup ideas to quickly gauge market interest.

5. **Collaborative Task Boards**
Integrated Kanban boards or task management tools for seamless team collaboration within the platform.

### Brief market research / problem validation

1. **Project Matchmaking System**
    - Platforms like GitHub, Indie Hackers, and AngelList allow developers to discover projects, but lack tailored, skill-based matchmaking.
    - Competitors focus mainly on job placement, not on passion projects or early-stage startups.
2.  **Startup Graveyard with Analytics**
    - The failure rate for startups remains high (~90%), yet there is limited structured learning from these failures in most startup platforms.
    - Aspiring entrepreneurs actively seek real failure stories to avoid common mistakes.


## Basic requirements

### Target users and their primary needs

- Startup Founders
Need: Find skilled developers, validate ideas, document startup journey.

- Developers
Need: Discover interesting projects, join meaningful teams, build portfolio.

- Entrepreneurs / Innovators
Need: Learn from failed startups, avoid common mistakes, get inspiration.

### User stories

- _As a startup founder_, I want to post my project idea so I can attract developers and collaborators.

- _As a developer_, I want to browse and filter projects based on my skills and interests so I can join relevant teams.

- _As a founder or team member_, I want to track project progress and share public roadmaps to increase transparency.

- _As a user_, I want to read and contribute to the startup graveyard to learn from past failures.

### Initial scope

- User authentication and profile creation

- Posting and browsing startup ideas

- Basic project matchmaking (filter by skills, interests)

- Startup graveyard with submission and browsing functionality
