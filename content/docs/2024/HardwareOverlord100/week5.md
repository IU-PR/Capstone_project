## Feedbacks

### Feedback collection plan

We used the Following feedback collection plan:

-   schedule a meeting with our potential client / mentor

-   ask him about the working environment ( factory in most cases ).

-   provide and show him the 3d model of the robot, indicating its
    dimensions, functionalities, how he can use it and mentioning
    adjustable parameters such as sensor precision or load capacity.

-   teach the user how to manipulate the 3d model to grasp a better
    understanding of the product.

-   Receive Feedback on the simplicity of usage, load capacity needed,
    size of the mobile platform, it's working and rechargeability
    duration.

### Conducted user surveys or feedback sessions

Every week we organize a feedback session with our mentor Ruslan
Damindarov. During these sessions,we show our progress and current
state of the project.

We also conducted additional feedback sessions with some companies
such as SPCF Beton which is a reinforced concrete manufacturing
company ( the meeting was online since the company is not based in
Russia).

### Analyzing feedback, identifying and prioritizing issues

After analyzing the feedback, we have identified the following issues: 

-   The size of the plate of the mobile platform might need to be
    adjusted depending on the type of wood support manufacturers might
    use.

-   The user interface and reachability of the emergency button might
    need to be adjusted to lower the risk of crashes.

-   The load capacity might need to be adjusted in case the user would
    surpass the weight limit.

-   The battery capacity needs to be upgraded to reach 4 hours of
    continuous work and the ability to recharge in 2 hours in order
    for the mobile platform to be fully functional during the working
    day.

## Roadmap: 

After the end of the Capstone Project course, we will continue work on
our product.

###  Improve the current CAD Design and the mobile platform assembly.

-   Use motors with higher power to get higher torque which would result
    in higher load capacity.

-   Get better, more presentable design

-   Create a more user-friendly charging system, which will be safer and
    faster than the existing one.

-   Use higher precision sensors such as replacing the HC-SR04
    ultrasonic sensor with CFAM 12N1600 sensor leading to higher range.

-   Implement Sensors Fusion module for a more accurate position
    estimation for the platform

## Weekly Progress Report:

For this week our team fully finished all of the calculations. The
electrical circuit was completely soldered with all parts present as
well. Also we almost finished 3d printing all of our modeled
special-purpose details and got missing parts ordered for them to arrive
in time.

### Challenges & Solutions 

-   Calculations turned out to be off in comparison to our original
    plans. Since they were done in a theoretical "excellent" world, we
    had to create a safety error factor and lower the maximum weight a
    little depending on the working conditions. As a solution, we
    decided to connect the maximum load capacity according to the
    client's working industrys' safety factors.

-   Delivery of some of the components was delayed due to unexpected
    reasons. Fortunately our team was ahead and the delay most likely
    won't affect our robot assembly as we could use other external
    resources as a quick fix.

### Conclusions & Next Steps 

For this week we met all of our expectations. For the next week our team
will focus on finishing printing needed 3d parts and assembling the
robot in the best and most secure way possible, so we can present a
fully functioning prototype by the end of the Capstone project.
