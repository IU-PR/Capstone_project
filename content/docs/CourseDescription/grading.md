## Weekly progress evaluation

### Report

- The report should be written simply and clearly, imagine that you are writing instructions on how to create your project from scratch, describe your decisions and how you came to them.
- Each report should contain:
    - A full description of the contribution of each participant with artifacts of the work (pull requests, commits, links to files in the repository or other relevant artifact)
    - Detailed plans for the next week (what are you going to do next week)
    - Description of the solution of [weekly tasks](/docs/coursedescription/weeklytasks/)

### Implementation with noticeable progress

- Your `master` branch must contain working code at any point in time. Make sure to put your solution in docker container, or make a proper documentation to run it simple way. If TA is not able to reproduce your solution (locally, in google colab or other), then it is considered as not working and you get 0 points for the implementation part.
- The progress for the week should correspond to the number of participants in your team. There should be no participants who have not done anything in a week.

### Personal contribution

- In the report and at the weekly meeting with TA, each participant must clearly explain their contribution for the week. The absence of work artifacts will result in 0 points for this part.

## Final presentation

- Your presentation should be organized and structured in a way that describes the development process and narrates a story of how you identified the problem and how you solved it.
- Avoid overloading your audience with text. Your presentation should be clear and concise, with illustrations and short accompanying text.
- People like stories, so tell yours! Share the challenges you faced, the mistakes you made, and the lessons you learned. This will show that you are a team that is willing to learn and adapt.
- Use the talents of your team members to create a dynamic and engaging presentation. For example, if you have someone on your team who is passionate about frontend development, let them tell the part of the story that covers frontend development.
- Your presentation should be short, only 10 minutes long. This means that you will need to be selective about what you include - choose the most important parts of your story and leave the rest.

## Project deployment

- Domain name
- Server
- Production and staging environment
- Github actions deployment
