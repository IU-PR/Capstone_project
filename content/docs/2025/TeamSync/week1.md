# Brainstorming

---

### **Ideas during brainstorming**

| Rank | Idea |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Smart university team-matching platform that helps students quickly and effectively find teammates for academic projects |
| **2** | Dynamic resource allocation between services by means of time series. For example, allocate a little more RAM to one or another service, give more cores, etc. Formalize as SaaS |
| **3** | AI-powered habit tracking application designed to help users develop and maintain positive habits through personalized recommendations and consistent tracking. |

### Problem validation

**1. Smart University Team-Matching Platform**

**Problem**: Students spend 5–10 hours forming teams manually, often leading to mismatches and delays.

**Validation**:

- Most use unstructured *Telegram* chats, *spreadsheets*. One of the more or less same sevice is already not working ([Pet-Plat](https://www.notion.so/48a5ad2acca54b06a08cd8edd14307a3?pvs=21))
- Professors report frequent issues with unbalanced teams.

**2. Dynamic Resource Allocation SaaS**

**Problem**: Cloud services often over- or under-use resources due to static allocation.

**Validation**:

- Time-series-based autoscaling is complex and costly to configure manually.
- Existing tools like *Cast.ai* are powerful but too advanced for small teams.

**3. AI-Powered Habit Tracking App**

**Problem**: Current habit trackers lack personalization, causing low long-term engagement.

**Validation**:

- Popular apps use generic reminders, not behavior-based adaptation.
- Users want smarter, context-aware support.

# Basic Requirements

## Problem Statement

Students of Innopolis University currently face the inefficiencies and time-consuming manual efforts when forming teams for academic projects, particularly during Capstone and elective-based collaborations. This results in suboptimal groups and delayed project starts.

## Solution

**TeamSync** aims to improve the quality and balance of student teams by offering a data-driven, user-friendly experience for discovering, evaluating, and matching with potential teammates.

## Target Users

**Primary Customers:** Innopolis University or other organizations.

**Primary Users:** Students of Innopolis University.

**Secondary Users:** Professors.

## User Stories

1. As a student, I want to create a personal profile with my skills, interests, and past projects so that I can be discovered by project creators or teammates.
2. As a student, I want to post a new project with a description and required skills, so that I can find teammates who match my needs.
3. As a student, I want to receive AI-generated teammate recommendations based on my skills and preferences, so that I can build a balanced and effective team faster.
4. As a student, I want to apply to projects that match my interests, so that I can participate in projects relevant to my skills and goals.
5. As a project owner, I want to accept or reject team applications and manage my team members, so that I can control who joins my project and maintain a good team structure.
6. As a student, I want to see suggestions and filters when browsing projects (similarity), so that I can efficiently choose which projects to join.
7. As a professor, I want to make a page only for my course, so that I can manage the team formation between my students.

## **Main Functionalities**

---

### **Smart Profiles**

A system that allows students to create detailed profiles with skills, interests, availability, and academic background.

- Students can input relevant information including tech stack, preferred project types, and availability.
- Students can make tags for better search and matching.
- The system supports real-time updates as students gain experience or complete courses.

### **Project Hub**

A centralized interface to browse, create, and manage project listings.

- Students can post project ideas with descriptions, required roles, and deadlines.
- Other users can browse available projects, filter by tags or requirements, and submit join requests.
- Each project shows team composition, required skills, and current progress status.

### **AI Matchmaking**

An intelligent recommendation engine for finding optimal team compositions.

- Recommends teammates or projects.
- Search engine.

### **Team Management Tools**

Features to organize and manage project teams effectively.

- Project owners can accept/reject applications and manage current team members.
- Team dashboards display role distribution, availability conflicts, and overall skill coverage.
- Notification system for team activity and status updates.

### **Analytics for Instructors**

 A dashboard for faculty to monitor team formation patterns.

- Includes ungrouped students, skill demand gaps, and team distributions.
- Helps professors support team-building proactively.

### **Search & Tagging System**

Enhanced discoverability through structured filtering and semantic tagging.

- Projects and profiles are enriched with tags based on content.
- Students can search based on interests, tools, tech stacks, or availability windows.
- Search results are ranked by relevance and user preferences.

### **User Feedback & Improvement Loop**

- Users can rate or flag recommendations to improve accuracy.
- Users can share feedback to the telegram of this project (will be created soon)
