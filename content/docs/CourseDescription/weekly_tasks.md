# Weekly Tasks & Project Guidelines

Each week, your team will tackle specific tasks, culminating in a functional project and a comprehensive report of your
work. Some tasks are common for all, while TAs will tailor others to your specific project. Important note:
delivering a well-structured, clear report is as crucial as writing functional code.

## Core Requirements (Applicable Every Week):

1. Master Branch Stability: Your `master` (or `main`) branch must contain working, runnable code at all times.
2. Reproducibility:
    * Package your solution in Docker containers and create a docker-compose file to run your project in one command.
    * Alternatively, provide crystal-clear documentation (e.g., a `README.md` with precise setup and run commands) to
      allow TAs to reproduce your solution easily.
    * If a TA cannot run your solution (locally, in Google Colab, Docker, or via a provided link), the implementation
      part for that week will receive 0 points.
3. Trackable Progress: Your progress must be visibly trackable week-over-week. This could be through:
    * More endpoints in Swagger/OpenAPI documentation.
    * Improved or new UI elements in the frontend.
    * New pages/flows in Figma designs.
    * An evolving Kanban board with completed tasks.
    * Expanded datasets or refined ML models.
4. Individual Contributions in Reports: Each weekly report *must* clearly list tasks completed by *each team member*
   with specific deliverables:
    * Designers: Screenshots of new/updated designs, links to Figma files (specific pages/frames), user flow diagrams.
    * Frontend Developers: Links to merged Pull Requests (PRs) or closed issues. Screenshots/GIFs of new UI components
      or functionality.
    * Backend Developers: Links to merged PRs or closed issues. Links to updated API documentation (e.g.,
      Swagger/OpenAPI).
    * Project Managers: Links to created/assigned issues, updated Kanban board (e.g., Trello, Jira, GitHub Projects),
      summary of customer/TA feedback and action items.
    * Analytics Specialists: Links to `.ipynb` notebooks, dashboards, datasets used/generated, key insights derived.
    * ML Developers: Links to source code (e.g., specific commits/PRs), model artifacts (e.g., Hugging Face model page,
      `.pkl` files in a repo), relevant research papers or techniques explored.
5. Report Submission:
    * Reports should be submitted as a `Markdown` file in the [Report repository](https://github.com/IU-PR/Capstone_project).
    * An example weekly report template can be found here: [Example Reports](/docs/2025/exampleproject/week1/)
