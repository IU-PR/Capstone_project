# Week #1

## Project description

### Project name: Fluently

**Code repository**: [https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/Fluently](https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/Fluently)

_This project will provide users rich ecosystem with ability to learn spoken english to become fluent. It will include mobile(both, ios and android) application, telegram bot and web extension. Application will consists of words learning via short pick options tests; have realistic conversations with AI assistant on relevant user-specific topics. It will have very flexible user experience customization. User can set goal, available hours, duration of lessons, level of difficulty. Telegram bot will provide short tests with picking from several options for fast and effective learning new words. Web extension will help you to save any interesting words you want to learn to user personal collection. This collection will have highest priority when words to learn will be suggested_

#### Problem Statement

There is no effective `fluent` English teaching application.

## Brainstorming

### Ideas during brainstorming

**1. Real-Time Cross-Platform Fitness Tracker**

_A mobile app (iOS/Android) with a Go backend that syncs workouts, nutrition, and health stats in real time. Includes AI-driven insights ("You burned 20% fewer calories today") and DevOps-automated scaling. Perfect for fitness enthusiasts who want data-driven progress tracking._

**2. Smart Home Hub with Anomaly Detection**

_A mobile-controlled smart home system (lights, thermostat) with AI-powered alerts for weird behavior ("Your fridge is using too much power!"). Uses Go for high-speed device communication and DevOps (Terraform/Grafana) for secure deployment. Ideal for IoT + security nerds._

**3. Decentralized Encrypted File Storage**

_A peer-to-peer Dropbox alternative where files sync across devices without central servers. Built with Go’s libp2p for networking, AES-256 encryption, and DevOps automation for node health checks. For privacy-focused users tired of Big Tech cloud storage._

### Brief market research / problem validation

**Wordich** - The service delivers short, daily lessons via a Telegram bot, utilizing spaced repetition based on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve to maximize retention, and is suitable for users from beginner to advanced levels (A1–C2)

**Duolingo** - Duolingo is a global leader in language learning apps, featuring over 100 courses in 41 languages, and is known for its gamified, bite-sized lessons that make language acquisition accessible and engaging for millions of users

## Basic requirements

### Target users

**English Proficiency Level**

A2-B1 (Pre-Intermediate to Intermediate): Needs structured learning but can handle basic conversations.

B2-C1 (Upper-Intermediate to Advanced): Aims for fluency refinement (e.g., idioms, accents)

**Age**

14 - 50 years old

**Hobby**

- general spoken english learning
- travelling
- international shopping
- business
- IELTS
- IT

### Primary needs of Users

- Improve spoken english skills by use learned words in realistic, relevant, user-specific conversations with AI

- Be able to upgrade CEFR Level by learning user-specific unique lessons with simple and fast tests (pick options)

- Has the ability to eco-system on any device (ios/android/telegram) and in any place (across the web)

- Get personalized learning based on level, goals, and schedule

- Get updatable visual statistics of the learning process and see progress

### User stories

1. As a user, I want to take lessons with new words with simple and quick (pick options) tests, so that learn the most frequently used vocabulary

2. As a user, I want to be able to ask any english-related questions, so that I can quickly get relevant and useful information

3. As a user, I want to have classification of words by the difficulty level (A1 – C2) and by different topics, so that I can get relevant knowledge considering my level and goal

4. As a user, I want to receive notifications about lessons, so that I don't forget to practice

5. As a user, I want to have conversations with the AI, so that practice speaking skills

### Initial scope

_Remarks (for further understanding):_

**Full functionality** - AI assistant for personalized conversations in real-time, learning new words based on their level and goal with getting notifications based on the famous Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.

**Partial functionality** - lack of AI assistant, (further - same as in full functionality) learning new words based on their level and goal with getting notifications based on the famous Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.

**Web extension functionality** - save words to personal words collection for learning in Fluently ecosystem

- IOS application with _full functionality_
- Android application with _full functionality_
- Telegram bot with _partial functionality_
- Web extension with ecosystem synchronization and with _web extension functionality_
