## Project idea  
Interactive game with walking around the space about the Innopolis University.  

Brief description:
Unity game where the player can walk through the main areas of the university (main hall and dormitory), interacting with the NPC and things and learning about life in Innopolis through mini-quests and dialogues.

According our research and analysis of the market - there is no games about Innopolis University, so it should be interesting and unique for the users interested in Innopolis University.

### Problem statement 
Many applicants and tourists do not have the opportunity to come to the university in person and learn about the student's life. We solve this by creating a virtual tour around the University with interaction. 

### Target users  
Applicants and their parents, tourists, guests.

### Users needs  
See what the university looks like

Understand atmosphere, infrastructure

Get involved in the process and student's life through the game interaction


Learn something new about the university

### User stories  
- As an applicant, I want to walk around the university online to understand how it works and feels.

- As a guest, I want to talk with the NPC (Professors/Students) to learn about students' lives.

- As a parent, I want to make sure that the students have good conditions.

- As a tourist, I want to go through the mini-quest to learn more about university.


### Initial scope 
**On MVP:**  
2 locations of the main hall with 7-8 interactions with objects

**Out of the MVP:**  
The other location with Student dormitory and canteen.
