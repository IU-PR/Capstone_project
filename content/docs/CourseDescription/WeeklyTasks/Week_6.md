# **Week #6**

{{< hint danger >}}
**Important Note**  
Dear all, we are pleased to see remarkable progress in your projects. We are coming close to the end of the semester and I am thrilled to see your first prototypes. Needless to say that we have been following your work closely and we are impressed with the creativity and innovation that you have all shown. 
{{< /hint >}}


This week, you will focus on polishing, packaging your prototypes, and crafting a final presentation. It is important to present your projects in the best possible light and outline the best possible use cases. Developing a project is different from selling it, but I believe you all have the necessary knowledge and understanding of what makes your project unique and why people should use it.
  
This primary focus of the week should be on:

- Polishing your projects to make sure they look complete and perform all of the MVP functionalities.
- Creating a compelling presentation that effectively communicates your project.

When creating your presentation, keep the following in mind:

- Your presentation should be organized and structured in a way that describes the development process and narrates a story of how you identified the problem and how you solved it.
- Avoid overloading your audience with text. Your presentation should be clear and concise, with illustrations and short accompanying text.
- People like stories, so tell yours! Share the challenges you faced, the mistakes you made, and the lessons you learned. This will show that you are a team that is willing to learn and adapt.
- Use the talents of your team members to create a dynamic and engaging presentation. For example, if you have someone on your team who is passionate about frontend development, let them tell the part of the story that covers frontend development.
- Your presentation should be short, only 10 minutes long. This means that you will need to be selective about what you include. - Choose the most important parts of your story and leave the rest.

Other important points to remember:

- Your progress reports are an integral part of your projects. We will be reading through them again to get a more complete understanding of your work. Please make sure that they are well-written and error-free.
- Treat your project page on the official website of the Capstone project as your welcome page. Make sure that it is well-written, well-structured and compelling.
- The final presentation should be converted to a PDF and uploaded to the first section of your project page. This will allow listeners to review your presentation at their own pace and ask questions.
- Deploy your project if you have not already done so. This will give the committee and fellow students a chance to see your work in action.
- The functionality of your UI is more important than the design. We will be looking at how well your UI facilitates the use of your application.
- And lastly, you and your team likely interacted with many other people inside and outside of the University. Make sure to pay proper credits for the help and support you have received. The fact that you've received help shows your proactivity and attempts to seek out best solutions, rather than being unknowledgeable in some ways.

Presentations will start at 10:00am. Exact room will be communicated later.
