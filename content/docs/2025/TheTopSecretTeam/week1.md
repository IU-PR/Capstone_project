>Also we are using some help from 1st year bachelor students (1st team).

## Brainstorming

### Ideas during brainstorming

*Put here your ranked ideas with short description*

Because we are doing project with 1st year students we have a stakeholder that provides project idea and instructions

But before that we had some other ideas.

1. The Lobotomy Corporation clone with COOP multiplayer feature. (Stakeholder Idea)
2. A CRM system for small businesses.
3. Referral system for small buisnesses.
4. Online booking system for events.

### Brief market research / problem validation

*Put here a brief market research/problem validation for 1â€“2 ideas*

#### CRM system

There is a growing market of small buisness owners who are looking for efficient solutions to manage customer relationships and time management.
By making a quick search, there are numerous CRM solutions available, but many are overly complex or expensive that do not cater specifically to the unique needs of small businesses.

#### Referral Client SystemCooperative anomaly management simulator (like Lobotomy Corporation) written in Godot enginear as our research goes there are no competitors in small business domain.

#### TheCOOrP

The only project with the same idea is a fan game called [Lobotomy Corporation 13](https://wiki.lc13.net/view/Main_Page) (LC13) that is a mod for 2003 game SS13 which has similar gameplay mechanics.

## Basic requirements

### Target users

A. Demographics
Age Range (e.g., teens 13-19, young adults 20-35)
Location (global)
B. Psychographics & Gaming Preferences
Casual Gamers
C. Platforms & Play Habits
PC

### User primary needs

A. Core Needs (Why Do They Play Games?)
Escapism/Immersion (Story-rich, atmospheric games like Firewatch)

Challenge & Mastery (Roguelikes, precision platformers like Celeste)

Social Connection (Multiplayer games like Among Us)

B. Pain Points (What Frustrates Them?)
Overpriced games -> Our game will be cheap.

Games require powerful systems -> Smooth performance on ost devices is critical.

### User stories

- As a player, I want to play in COOP so that i can have fun with my friends.
- As a player, I want to have an interesting gameplay so that i wont get bored.
- As a player, I want to interact with anomalies so that i can progress the game.
- A a player i want to see appealing visuals so i can immerse myself in the game world.

### Initial scope

MVP should contain: Working Multiplayer, Basic Agent Management, Textures and Soundtrack and Basic gameplay loop.
MVP will NOT contain: Agent Customization, Anomalies Escape sequences, any progress beyond 1st level.

### Additional progress report

We will also include 1st year students progress into our report to avoid confusions in the future.

## Tech-stack

* Godot Engine
* GDScript
* Docker

## Confirmation of the code's operability

We confirm that the code in the main branch:

- [x] In working condition.
- [x] Run via docker-compose (or another alternative described in the `README.md`).
