# üí° Project Idea

## Problem Statement

Fitness and health are booming industries, but people are tired of one-size-fits-all solutions. They are looking for personalized guidance that adapts to their needs. At the same time, trainers want to share their knowledge but struggle to package it effectively or reach an audience online.

Moreover, the Internet is overflowing with conflicting advice from self-proclaimed experts, leaving people overwhelmed and confused. This overload of opinions creates paralysis, making it harder for individuals to take action or stick with a plan.

Meanwhile, trainers have valuable insights but lack the digital tools and strategies to grow their reputation and attract clients. Many great ideas get lost, helping no one. Our mission is to cut through the noise, make first steps easier for users, and help trainers connect with the people who need them most.

## Competitive Analysis

Competitors either provide pre-made workouts (with no real coach interaction), serve as promotional platforms (like Instagram* or YouTube), or simply function as marketplaces.

| **Platform**                | **Available Features**                      | **Missing / Pain Points**                                |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Fitify, Nike Training Club  | Ready-made plans, tracking                  | No live coaches, no adaptation to individual needs       |
| AllTrainer, Profi.ru        | Specialist search, personalized programs    | Few digital-first coaches, no quick monetization path    |
| Patreon / Boosty            | Subscriptions, private content              | No fitness-specific features, no user goal matching      | 
| Instagram*                  | Promotion and branding                      | Unstructured content, no real system                     |
| YouTube                     | Tons of free content                        | Hard to personalize, difficult to discover what fits you |

**Problem:** UGC platforms (like YouTube, Udemy, marketplaces) often face content quality issues. Without filters, trainers might upload irrelevant or even harmful content.  
**Validation:** Most major platforms use content filters ‚Äî either automated or manual. A basic NLP scanner (even without ML) already helps a lot. Users expect to pay for actual workout programs, not junk.

**Problem:** Fitness apps like Fitify, Nike Training Club, or MyFitnessPal often lack real customization ‚Äî users manually look for plans that match their goals and level.  
**Validation:** Personalization is key to retention. Simplified algorithms for recommending suitable workout plans are already used successfully in health/fitness apps. We can apply a lightweight version based on user‚Äôs questionnaire data, even at MVP stage.

## Goal

The goal of our project is to simplify trainer-side workout plan uploads while automating user-side matching of optimal training programs.

## Solution

Our solution simplifies workout plan creation for trainers while using AI to match users with perfectly tailored programs. We combine live coaches, smart matching, fast knowledge integration, AI-powered tools, and - most importantly - effortless monetization. Trainers don‚Äôt need marketing skills to earn, and clients don‚Äôt need expertise to find value - our service handles the selection for them, ensuring they only get what works.

## Ideas during brainstorming

### 1. Quality check for uploaded workout plans  
Use a lightweight NLP model (or manual moderation at first) to filter out irrelevant content. The workout plan should contain structured training info like sets, timing, rest periods, and proper exercise names.

### 2. Workout cards instead of long texts  
Structure the training plans into short, clean cards showing key elements: exercise name, sets, rest time, etc. Easy to read. In the future ‚Äî we‚Äôll add visuals like icons, images, and videos.

### 3. Basic progress tracker  
Allow users to mark workouts as ‚Äúdone‚Äù and maybe leave a note. No calendar integration for MVP ‚Äî keep UX simple.

### 4. Trainer verification & trust system  
Trainers can upload certificates. Show ‚Äúverified‚Äù badge on profile. Ratings and reviews will boost trust. Internal badges or ‚Äúrecommended by platform‚Äù can highlight new or quality trainers.

### 5. Workout recommendation algorithm based on user data  
Take into account the user‚Äôs goals, level, and any contraindications. Show programs that match their needs. Possibly with a short explanation powered by AI.

### 6. Flexible program upload for trainers  
Trainers can either upload PDFs, scan paper notes, or fill out structured forms. We‚Äôll process and turn it into proper workout cards.

### 7. Built-in injury disclaimer and health filters  
Add a legal disclaimer like ‚ÄúUse at your own risk.‚Äù Filter programs that might be unsafe for specific user conditions using LLM or basic keyword checks.

## Metrics of Success

To measure the success of our project, we would use the following metrics:

- **Feature Completion Rate** ‚Äì Aim to implement 100% of the core features (MVP) defined in our project scope.
- **System Stability** ‚Äì During testing, the system should run with zero critical bugs and less than 3 minor issues.
- **User Feedback Score** ‚Äì From peer reviewers or instructors, we aim for an average satisfaction rating of 8 out of 10.
- **Task Success Rate** ‚Äì At least 90% of test users should be able to complete key tasks without assistance (e.g., following a plan, navigating the UI).

Given the academic nature of the project, real-world adoption is out of scope for now, but these metrics allow us to evaluate the effectiveness and readiness of the system.

## Challenges & Solutions
The main challenge we faced was differing perspectives on the project details. To address this, we reached an agreement on the core functionality and defined clear, specific requirements. This ensured that all team members share a unified understanding of the project moving forward.

## Conclusions & Next Steps
During the first week, we made progress by defining the main goal of the project and outlining our future plans. In the upcoming week, our focus will shift to designing the project interface and beginning implementation based on the established backlog.

**We confirm that the code in the main branch:**
- In working condition.
- Run via docker-compose.
