# Week #1

## Project description

### Project name: UniTrip
**Code repository**: https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/UniTrip  
Unity version - 2022.3.56f1

### Detailed description
Our project is the Unity game where the player can walk through the main areas of the university (main hall and dormitory), interacting with the NPC(students/professors) and objects in locations to learn about life in Innopolis through mini-quests and dialogues.  
User open the game and see main screen with first location(first part of main hall). Also user see 3 "!" marks with possibilities to click and open the dialogs with professor, and 2 secutity men.  
After passing the dialogs with the second secutiry man you have opportunity to pass to the second location with more quests such as look at 108 auditorium or buy something in the vending mashine. The fully detailed description of the scenario is attached in the contribution part below. It will be finalized in the next week.   


### Problem statement 
Many applicants and tourists do not have the opportunity to come to the university in person and learn about the student's life. We solve this by creating a virtual tour around the University with interaction.

## Brainstorming 

### Ideas during brainstorming

1. **Interactive game about Innopolis University**  
Walk through University locations and interact with objects and NPCs to learn something new about Innopolis
2. **Service discovery and advertising platform for Innopolis**  
A unified application for finding, booking, and promoting local services in the city of Innopolis (beauty salons, massage, health services, repair, etc.). The app will offer a structured and user-friendly alternative to fragmented Telegram chats and word-of-mouth recommendations. Users will be able to easily browse available services, read reviews, save favorites, and sign up â€” all within a single app, without relying on Telegram or WhatsApp.

3. **Personal AI Health Assistant**  
A virtual personal doctor AI-agent that helps users monitor and manage their health. The assistant keeps track of personal medical data (such as blood type, doctor visits, test results), answers health-related questions, and provides reliable information to avoid the common problem of users self-diagnosing through unverified internet sources. 

4. **Tower defense game**  
Tower defense game in Zombie style, called Defendead. It was our project in previous year, there was 3 levels and we could improve it by adding new levels, new monsters and more waves(also add multiplayer, rank, in-game currency and etc).


### Brief market research / problem validation
1. **Interactive game about Innopolis University** 

Problem:  
Many prospective students, their parents, and tourists do not have the opportunity to visit Innopolis University in person(who lives far away). However even someone, who could visit University - cannot do it without guide and doesn't have opporunity to walk free and interact with objects/people.

Market:  
- Prospective students applying to Innopolis University (~ 14 thousands yearly).
- Parents of prospective students (number of students * 2 = 28 thosands).
- Tourists and guests interested in Innopolis city and  university (~100-150 thousands yearly )

Validation:
- Official university tours are limited in frequency and location-based.
- Discussions with guides show that tourists often look for visual and interactive materials.
- Current online resources do not allow interaction with university spaces or immersion into student life.

2.  **Service discovery and advertising platform for Innopolis** 

Problem:  
Finding local services in Innopolis is currently inefficient and fragmented. Information is spreaded across multiple Telegram groups and chats. Newcomers often experience information overload, while new businesses struggle to advertise themselves. Additionally, Telegram is not optimized for service discovery and lacks proper filtering, search, and review mechanisms.

Market:
- City of Innopolis ( ~ 5-7k population and growing).
- Newcomers (students, specialists relocating to work in IT companies).
- Local businesses and entrepreneurs providing services (beauty, healthcare, repair, education, etc.).

Validation:
- Personal experience and feedback from new residents show that searching for services usually involves joining dozens of Telegram chats and browsing through unstructured posts.
- New local businesses advertising in Telegram chats is ineffective and tough.

## Basic requirements

### Target users  
Applicants and their parents, tourists, guests.

Their needs:

- See what the university looks like

- Understand atmosphere, infrastructure

- Get involved in the process and student's life through the game interaction

- Learn something new about the university

### User stories  
- As an applicant, I want to walk around the university online to understand how it works and feels.

- As a guest, I want to talk with the NPC (Professors/Students) to learn about students' lives.

- As a parent, I want to make sure that the students have good conditions.

- As a tourist, I want to go through the mini-quest to learn more about university.


### Initial scope 
**On MVP:**  
2 locations of the main hall with 7-8 interactions with objects

**Out of the MVP:**  
The other locations such as student's dormitory and canteen.  

## Tech stack:  
- **Unity** for the game creation.   
We use it because it is simple and fast in development, supports all functionality that we need and known by our team. 
- **Blender** for 3D model creations  
Also fast, simple and known
- **Procreate** for design  
Suggest wide functionality for creating the design - professional and comfort in use.
- **Github pages** for deploy  
Easy in use, could be automized by Github actions

## Confirmation of the code's operability

We confirm that the code in the main branch:
- [ ] In working condition.
- [ ] Run via docker-compose (or another alternative described in the `README.md`).

## Plans for next week
- Write detailed user stories and user flow diagrams.
- Finalize the narrative for the game.
- Create a backlog with all tasks, estimation and sprints.
- Create a prototype of 2 locations.
- Upload the 3d model of the first location in Unity.
- Add main character and it's walking around the ares. 
- Create a first interactions with objects in location.
- Learn camera transitions in Unity and try to apply.
