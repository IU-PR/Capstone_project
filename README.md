## Brief description of the project
A puzzle-platformer game with a fairytale setting, mixed with cyberpunk elements. Involves the paper-like artstyle, simple but intriguing mechanics, and a touch of light phylosophy. Lamps are significant and playable objects: player advances through the levels and interacts with the world by manipulating them.
