# Week #1

## Project description

### Project name: *Recommendation System*

**Code repository**: https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/Recommendation-System

**General idea**

The project is a distributed system that enables users to rate books. Based on their reading history and given ratings, the system generates personalized recommendations.

**Problem Statement**

In today's world, where thousands of books across various genres and topics are published every day, it becomes increasingly difficult for the average user to choose what to read. Faced with *information overload* and *a general decline in reading habits*, users are less willing to spend time browsing and comparing options. They expect **fast**, **accurate**, and **personalized recommendations**. 

Our motivation for this project is to address this growing challenge by developing a scalable, efficient recommendation system that processes large volumes of user-generated data (ratings, reviews) and delivers high-quality book recommendations tailored to individual preferences ‚Äî all with minimal delay. This not only enhances user experience but also promotes reading by reducing friction in the decision-making process. 

*Key problems* include managing data consistency across components, optimizing performance for analytical workloads, and optionally, integrating ML techniques for semantic understanding of user feedback.

## Brainstorming

### Ideas during brainstorming

1. **Efficient Personalized Recommendations** ‚Äì Apply data engineering for generating recommendations for a larger audience  with less computational power (Use an analytical database and independently create data marts outside the backend to reduce its load)

2. **Discovery Mode** ‚Äì Optional toggle to recommend books outside the user‚Äôs comfort zone, promoting discovery. 

3. **Mood-Based Recommendations** *(optional)* ‚Äì Recommends books based on inferred or user-selected moods (e.g., "thought-provoking").

### Brief market research / problem validation


After a brief market research, we identified several products similar to ours. However, upon analyzing them, we concluded that they fail to meet some of our key requirements, which makes the development of our own solution *relevant and justified*.

**Goodreads** uses a hybrid recommendation system (based on reading history, ratings, friends, and similar books), but it is primarily focused on the **English-speaking market**.

**Bookmate (Yandex Books)** is a monolithic mobile application **limited to its internal licensed content**. In contrast, our project is a **distributed system** designed for scalability, microservice architecture, and easy integration with external platforms.
