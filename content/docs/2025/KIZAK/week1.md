## 💡 Project Idea

### 🚨 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-paced and ever-changing IT landscape, newcomers face an overwhelming number of frameworks, libraries, tools, and learning platforms. Choosing the right career path, identifying the most relevant technologies, and creating a structured learning plan often feels confusing and frustrating—especially without expert guidance.


### 🔍 Market Research

Although several platforms aim to solve similar challenges, each comes with unique advantages and limitations. To shape a more refined and comprehensive solution, our team analyzed **six comparable projects**, identifying key features, shortcomings, and gaps in the current market.
