### **Tech Stack:**

**Backend:** Python will be used for backend development, and the specific framework will be chosen at a later stage based on project requirements and team expertise. This flexibility allows us to select the most suitable framework that aligns with our project goals.

**Data Storage (Mobile):** CoreData will be used for local data storage within the iOS application, providing efficient and reliable storage and retrieval of user data on the device.

**Deployment:** We'll utilize TestFlight for beta testing and distributing pre-release versions of our iOS app to external testers, allowing for feedback and bug testing before the official release. This streamlined approach to deployment ensures efficient testing and validation of our application without the immediate need for cloud platform deployment.

**Design and Prototyping:** Figma will be utilized for designing and prototyping the user interface, allowing for collaborative design iterations and ensuring a seamless user experience.

**Mobile Development:** For iOS mobile development, we'll use Swift programming language and the iOS SDK to create a native mobile application. Swift will enable us to build high-performance, feature-rich applications optimized for iOS devices. We'll also utilize API integration to connect our iOS app with backend services for data retrieval and manipulation.
