# Weekly tasks

Each week you will have to solve tasks and write report about your work. Some tasks will be common for all students, some tasks will be assigned to you by the TAs for your project specifically. Remember, that delivering proper report is as important as writing working code.

There are several requirements which are important for all weeks
- Your `master` branch must contain working code at any point in time. Make sure to put your solution in docker container, or make a proper documentation to run it simple way. If TA is not able to reproduce your solution (locally, in google colab or other), then it is considered as not working and you get 0 points for the implementation part.
- Your progress must be easily trackable across multiple weeks (e.g. more endpoints in swagger, improved frontend, new pages in figma, etc.)
- Each report must contain list of tasks done by each person with deliverables: 
    - Designers provide screenshots and `.fig` files
    - Frontend and backend developers provide links to closed issues or merged pull requests
    - Project managers provide links to created and assigned issues, link to kanban board, customer feedback
    - Analytics provide `.ipynb` files, dashboards, datasets
    - ML-developers provide links to source code, model artifacts (e.g. huggingface), research papers
