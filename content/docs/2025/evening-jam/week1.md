# Week #1

## Project description

### Project name: Evening Jam 

**Code repository**: https://github.com/fantom73d/evening-jam

A puzzle-platformer game with a fairytale setting, mixed with cyberpunk elements. Involves the paper-like artstyle, simple but intriguing mechanics, and a touch of light phylosophy. Lamps are significant and playable objects: player advances through the levels and interacts with the world by manipulating them. 

Problem statement: create a game that provides an enjoyable and fascinating way to spend time with a creative but not overwlelming brain training and an easy-to-follow storyline.

## Brainstorming

### Ideas during brainstorming

Main concept ideas (from fittest to less fittest ranked in descending order)

| Name                       | Short description                                                                                                                  | 
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  Light bulbs in the fantastic world | The setting is focused on the idea of the manipulation with the light to solve problems: interesting and gives freedom for plot choices |
| Character is a robot       | Can integrate interesting mechanics involving the player himself
| Character is a human       | People more readily sympathise with other people                                                                                   |
| Gamification of Innopolis Bootcamp (totally different setting) | Interesting but hard to implement everything + members of the team wanted to focus on the full game 
| Light affects colors       | The world is monochrome, which can be interestingly explained by some plot: in the usual world, the oblects reflect light and we see colors, in this, it doesn't work |
| A tower like a playground  | Helps to see the progress with visual representation      |
| Main character is the outsider | A natural scientist suddently gets into the fairytale-like world and firstly very sceptical about it; idea is okay but not really matches the cyberpunk setting with the lamps |                                                                                 |

Game Mechanics Ideas

| Name                       | Short description                                                                                                                  | 
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Incandescent light bulb    | Light up the paper sheet that will burn out with time                                                                              | 
| Broken fragments of a bulb | Player torns himself if he steps on the fragments (because the character is made of paper)                                         | 
| Bulbs of different powers  | Example: one lamp can power the lift but cannot turn on the drawbridge                                                             | 
| De-energised world         | The whole world is freezed but the player can give life to its objects/inhabitants only temporarily by using lamps as accumulators | 
| Screwed in light bulb      | Npc can become "revived"/active by putting a lamp in him/her                                                                       |
| Broken lamp influence 1    | If the lamp is broken it leaks the energy and cannot be used forever                                                               |
| Geometry changes           | If you insert the light bulb into yourself your hitbox is increased and you cannot get into small passages                         |
| Broken lamp influence 2    | A broken lamp inserted into a mechanism will activate it abruptly, with repeated ons and offs. Example: an elevating platform becomes a trampoline |
| Light mechanics            | Player can light his/her way up with a light bulb                                                                                  |



### Brief market research / problem validation

Puzzle-platformers are distinguished and widely played, as well as loved by the players for their authenticity and simple cognitive training. They also provide a solid ground for the indi developers with small teams and give the opportunity to focus on story telling and interesting mechanics. 

Examples in the market:

Renowned platformers

- Limbo by Playdead: very atmospheric with subtle but prominent social shadowing, interesting mechanics involved 
- Badland by HypeHype Inc: more dynamic due to its sidescrolling game process, puzzles with the world objects 
- Machinarium by Amanita Design: beautiful design with cyberpunk style, puzzles based on the mechanisms manipulations, similar to our project and also has paper-based arts 

Games that also used light as a base for game mechanics:

- Closure by Eyebrow Interactive: based on manipulation of light and shadows: player can use the object only if it is visible. Was innovative with this concept at its time and gained wide recognition
- Candleman by Spotlightor Interactive: a player has to use light from a candle to pass the level, but it extinguishes after the time is up. Similar to our idea with a broken lamp and adds a possibility for timer-based quests 

## Basic requirements

### Target users and their primary needs

Our target users are casual players without any specific background. We want our game to be fascinating for any ages: the puzzles should be understandable but not dumbed-down, and the story should be enjoable and provide the ground for light contemplation both for kids and adults. Our aim is to give our players a way to spend time with some intellectual stimulation and aesthetic pleasure. 

As a side consideration, we want our game to be suitable for for avid indi games players through its inventive mechanics and original storyline. The users who seek something innovative and authentic should also enjoy the gaming process. 

### User stories

- As a casual player, I want to solve puzzles on my own and in adequate time, so I can enjoy the game and move forward.
- As a busy person, I want to play for a short time session, so my mind is relaxed after a long day.
- As a reader, I want to see the interesting plot and ideas, so I have something to think about.
- As an experienced player, I want see new problems and design choices, so my game process is not repetative and boring.
- As a visual content consumer, I want to see a beautiful art style, so I am aesthetically satisfied.


### Initial scope

- Core mechanics
    - platformer with a puzzles-based advancement through the world
    - manipulation with light bulbs to interact with the world and solve logical problems

    - Several levels
    - Quick introduction to the mechanics

## *Something else you want to add*

If it possible, we would like to provide a new name for the project in Week 2. 
Also, we did not setup the Docker Compose yet since during this week we were mostly discussing and deciding things considering our project.
