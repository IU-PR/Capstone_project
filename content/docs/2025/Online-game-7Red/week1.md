## Brainstorming

### Ideas during brainstorming

1) **Multiplayer 7Red (Card Game)** – An online version of the Russian  game "7Red" with statistics, achievements and private rooms for friends. 

2) **Digital Menu & Order System for Happiness** – A lightweight web app for cafés to manage pickup orders, with real-time kitchen updates, SMS notifications, and prep time estimates. (Note: The "Happiness" café said they don’t need it)

3) **Dorm Room Swap Platform** – A matchmaking system for students to trade dorm rooms based on preferences like floor/campus or roommate compatibility (Note: already exists in our dorm).

4) **Smart Moving Checklist Generator** – A web app that creates personalized packing lists based on room size, distance, and season, integrating with Google Keep/Todoist for tracking (Note: though AI can do this now).



### Brief market research


1. **Multiplayer 7Red (Russian Card Game)**

Market Opportunity:

- Card games like UNO Online, Hearts, and Exploding Kittens have strong online player bases.

- Traditional 7Red board game have loyal followings but no digital adaptations.

Competitors:

- No major polished, standalone 7Red online versions exist. The only competitors  suffer from poor design, bad UX, and slow performance: https://ru.boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=redsevengame

Conclusion:

- Strong niche demand with little competition—worth developing 


2. **Digital Menu & Order System for Happiness**
Market Opportunity:

- Small cafés often rely on Telegram or phone calls — leading to errors and slow customer service.

Competitors:

- Yandex Eats: Expensive, overkill for small businesses.

Conclusion: 

- Interviews with café owners reveal -"Happiness café" rejection suggests lack of immediate pain point—indicating a need for better problem-sales fit.

## Basic requirements
