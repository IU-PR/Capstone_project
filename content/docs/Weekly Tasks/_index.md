# **Introduction** 

**Welcome** to the exciting and challenging world of the Capstone project! Over the next 7 weeks, you will embark on a remarkable academic journey that will push the boundaries of your knowledge and skills in the realm of technology and innovation.

In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our daily lives. From personalized recommendations on streaming platforms to autonomous vehicles, AI has transformed the way we interact with technology. As future leaders in the field, it is essential for us to not only understand the capabilities of AI but also learn how to harness its potential to build innovative software projects.

AI is not just a passing trend; it is here to stay. As AI continues to advance, it is crucial for us to adapt and acquire the skills necessary to effectively utilize this powerful technology. This project aims to provide you with the opportunity to not only gain technical expertise in AI but also develop essential soft skills required for successful collaboration, working towards a shared vision, and creating meaningful projects.

# **What this project is about?** 

## **The Capstone project** 
This is a unique opportunity for you to collaborate with a team of talented individuals and bring your ideas to life. The goal is to build a tech product that showcases your creativity, problem-solving abilities, and technical expertise. The project also aims to further develop your soft skill and practice effective communication to achieve a shared group vision. You will be tasked to develop a project vision, decompose it into smaller subparts and execute on the predefined plan.

## **Team Formation**

To kickstart this project, you will form a team consisting of either 5 or 7 individuals. Collaborating with diverse perspectives and skill sets will enrich your project and contribute to its success. Choose your team members wisely and ensure a balance of complementary talents.

## **Project Scope and Tiers**

Your project should be loosely defined within three tiers: **WEB, MOBILE, or ML (Machine Learning)**. This classification will help you focus your efforts and align your project's goals with the chosen tier. You will have the opportunity to explore and apply cutting-edge technologies specific to your selected tier. You can collaborate with other teams to build complementary projects - i.e, one group is doing WEB, other team MOBILE and third works on ML and backend. 

## **Embracing AI**

We strongly encourage you to explicitly incorporate AI into your project. Aim to plan, utilize, and build using AI technologies. By harnessing the power of AI, you can enhance the functionality and user experience of your tech product. Be innovative and think of unique ways to leverage AI in your project.

## **Leveraging Open-Source**

Open-source resources are invaluable for your project's success. Embrace the power of open-source technologies and frameworks to accelerate your development process and tap into the vast knowledge and support of the open-source community. Remember, we do not check for plagiarism; instead, we value your ability to utilize open-source effectively.

## **Engaging Experts**

Take advantage of every opportunity to seek guidance and assistance from experts in relevant domains. Experts can provide valuable insights, mentorship, and help you navigate through technical challenges. Don't hesitate to reach out to them and convince them to contribute to the success of your project.

## **Build With a Vision**:

Aim to develop a project with the potential to evolve into a fully-fledged product after the Capstone project. Choose the project that you think will be feasible to work on after the course will end. The Capstone project aims to give you the initial momentum, that can be carried further. Seek out individuals who possess expertise in relevant domains, as they can offer insights, mentorship, and assistance in overcoming technical hurdles. Once the prototype is ready - you and your team can iteratively improve, reaching a level of the finished product. 
## **Project Evaluation**

Your project will be evaluated solely on its merit and functionality. We will focus on whether your solution effectively solves the stated problem and if all the features are fully operational. Demonstrating a well-executed and functional tech product will be the key to achieving a good grade in this Capstone project.

Embrace this incredible opportunity to showcase your skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. The Capstone project is your chance to make a lasting impact in the world of technology. Good luck, and may your journey be filled with growth, innovation, and success!
