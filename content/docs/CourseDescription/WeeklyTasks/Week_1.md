**Week #1 is the most crucial week of the entire semester as it sets the foundation for your project**. During this week, your primary tasks are to form your team and select a project. The team formation process should carefully consider the skills, expertise, and compatibility of team members to ensure effective collaboration.

Once your team is formed, it is essential to pitch and discuss project ideas among yourselves. Select a project that aligns with one of the three tiers: web, mobile, or ML (machine learning). The chosen project should be well-defined, feasible, and have a clear problem statement.

Additionally, we expect each team to maintain a weekly progress report blog. These reports are a crucial means of tracking the progress of your projects. Each team is required to submit a report **no later than Monday 10:00 am of each week**. The reports should be informative, substantive, and provide a detailed account of your progress. It is important to clearly explain what you have accomplished, how you have achieved it, and any obstacles or challenges you have encountered.

These weekly reports will be evaluated, and feedback will be provided to assist you in the successful completion of your projects. Therefore, it is crucial to submit your reports on time and ensure they reflect the substantial progress you have made throughout the week.

We encourage you to use this blog as a platform to share your accomplishments, insights, and challenges. It is a valuable opportunity to communicate your ideas, seek feedback, and engage with your peers. By actively participating and sharing your experiences, you contribute to the collaborative learning environment we aim to foster.

When building a team for a software project consisting of 5-7 people, it is crucial to pay attention to the following:

1. **Skills and Expertise**: Ensure that the team members possess the necessary skills and expertise required for the project. Consider their technical knowledge, programming languages, frameworks, and any specific domain expertise relevant to the project.

2. **Collaboration and Communication**: Look for individuals who can effectively collaborate and communicate with one another. Strong teamwork and clear communication channels are essential for seamless coordination and successful project execution.

3. **Roles and Responsibilities**: Clearly define roles and responsibilities for each team member. Assign tasks based on their strengths and expertise to optimize productivity and ensure a well-rounded team composition.

4. **Diversity**: Seek a diverse mix of skills, perspectives, and backgrounds within the team. This can foster creativity, innovation, and a broader range of problem-solving approaches.

5. **Leadership**: Identify a capable team lead or project manager who can provide guidance, set clear goals, and facilitate decision-making processes. Leadership skills are crucial to keeping the team motivated and on track.

6. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Select team members who are adaptable and comfortable working in a dynamic environment. Software projects often encounter changes, and team members should be open to adjusting their approaches and strategies as required.

7. **Problem-solving Abilities**: Look for individuals with strong problem-solving skills. They should be able to analyze complex issues, propose effective solutions, and work well under pressure.

8. **Team Dynamics**: Consider the overall team dynamics and ensure compatibility among team members. A cohesive and supportive team environment can enhance productivity and foster a positive work culture.

9. **Shared Vision**: Ensure that all team members understand and align with the project's vision and goals. A shared sense of purpose can foster motivation, commitment, and a unified approach to project delivery.

Remember, building a successful software project goes beyond individual skills. It requires a combination of technical expertise, effective communication, collaboration, and a shared commitment to achieving project goals. By paying attention to these aspects, you can lay a strong foundation for your team's success.

### **Value Proposition**

The value proposition of your software project defines the unique benefits and advantages it offers to its users. It highlights the problem your project aims to solve and the positive outcomes it brings. Here's an expanded explanation to help you craft a compelling value proposition:

- Identify the Problem:
Clearly define the problem or pain point that your software project addresses. Analyze the challenges or inefficiencies faced by users in the targeted domain. Consider the specific pain points, bottlenecks, or limitations they encounter.

- Solution Description:
Explain how your software project provides a solution to the identified problem. Outline the key features, functionalities, or services that directly tackle the pain points. Emphasize the unique aspects of your solution that set it apart from existing alternatives.

- Benefits to Users:
Describe the benefits that users will experience by using your software project. Highlight how it enhances their productivity, efficiency, or effectiveness. Identify the positive outcomes, cost savings, time savings, or improved experiences they can expect.

- Differentiation:
Discuss what sets your software project apart from competing solutions. Identify the unique selling points, innovative features, or competitive advantages that make it a superior choice for users. Clearly articulate why users should choose your solution over others available in the market.

- User Impact:
Explain the broader impact your software project has on users and potentially the society or industry as a whole. Highlight any positive changes, transformative effects, or advancements that result from the adoption of your solution. Consider how it improves workflows, empowers users, or drives positive change.

- User Testimonials or Use Cases:
Whenever possible, provide real-world examples, user testimonials, or case studies that demonstrate the value and benefits of your software project. Showcasing tangible results and success stories adds credibility and reinforces the value proposition.

Remember to keep your value proposition concise, clear, and compelling. Focus on the most significant benefits and outcomes that resonate with your target users. A well-crafted value proposition effectively communicates the value and impact of your software project, making it more appealing and compelling to users.


## **Lean Questionnaire**

Please answer the following questions related to the lean methodology:

1. What problem or need does your software project address?
2. Who are your target users or customers?
3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?
4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?
5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?


## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

Again, this can be tentative, but explain how your team plans to leverage the following resources for the development and success of your project:

- AI (Artificial Intelligence)
- Open-Source
- Experts in relevant domains

## **Defining the Vision for Your Project**

A clear and compelling vision is crucial for successful project planning. When you have a well-defined concept and a shared vision of what you aim to achieve, executing on that vision becomes significantly easier. Therefore, after thorough discussions and settling on a promising idea, it is essential to craft a comprehensive vision with your team. This vision should be detailed, encompassing your chosen tech stack, and anticipate potential future challenges. Below, describe your project using schematic drawings and provide elaborate explanations of all significant components.

- Overview:
Provide a concise summary of your project, highlighting its purpose and value proposition.
Explain how your project addresses a specific problem or need in the chosen domain.
Clearly state the intended benefits and impact on users or stakeholders.

- Schematic Drawings:
Use visual representations such as diagrams, flowcharts, or wireframes to illustrate the structure and flow of your project.
Include all essential components, modules, and interactions within the system.
Ensure the drawings are clear, labeled, and easily understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- Tech Stack:
Specify the technologies, frameworks, and programming languages you plan to utilize in your project. This can be preliminary, but it is important for us to see that you have a tentative plan. 
Justify your tech stack choices based on their suitability for the project requirements and team expertise.
Consider scalability, performance, security, and ease of development when selecting your tech stack.
