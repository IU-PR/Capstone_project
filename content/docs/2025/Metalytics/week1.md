# Week #1

## Project description

### Project name: *Metalytics*

**Code repository**: [https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/LINK_TO_YOUR_REPOSITORY](https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/Metalytics)

#### Description
The goal of this project is to develop an analytical system for forecasting the prices of specific metals traded on the Russian financial market.
The system aims to explore and implement modern approaches to metal price prediction, analyzing historical price patterns, market volume data, and seasonal trends. Based on this research, the project will propose a set of analytical tools tailored for monitoring and forecasting the behavior of selected metal types — such as gold, nickel, or aluminum.
In addition to raw forecasting, the system will also generate explainability reports to help interpret observed and predicted price movements. These reports will incorporate contextual factors such as macroeconomic indicators, sanctions, major news events, and global market volatility, providing insights that may influence investor decision-making.

#### Problem Statement
One of the major flaws is that private investors and analysis lack access to precious metals with tools involving predictive modeling and explainability based on some external circumstances. This project attempts to fill the gap through a focused system with the ability to forecast metal prices as well as giving the reasons for such forecasts in an interpretable, automated manner.
