   ## Brainstorming

   ### Ideas during brainstorming 

   We decide to complete our Ideas in order, by their priority:

   1. **Drawing symbols for battle** *(main idea)*  
      The player *fights with enemies*, quickly *drawing* the *symbols* that appear on the screen.   
      The more accurately and faster it draws \- the stronger and faster the attack. 

   2. **Symbols combo**  
      Several symbols drawn *in a row and for a small period* of time will create a *combo*.   
      Combo delivers a *critical damage* depending on the complexity of the symbols.  
      
   3. **Increasing the complexity of enemies and values**  
      The player *defeats the enemies*, uses progressively more *complex combos*, learning new symbols and getting new abilities.  
      
   4. **Progressing with store purchases**  
      From the defeated enemies and some places on the map, the player will receive *coins* that can be exchanged with the merchant in the *store*.   
      Store \- a *single (small) shop* at a *certain point on the map.*	  
      
   5. **Setting up the skills of the character**  
      The possibility of *customization* of the hero: set some of *available symbols/abilities.*

   

   ### Brief market research / problem validation 

   We analyzed the market of such games and collected a small sum of information about them:

   | Game                         | Short description                                     | Advantages                                | Disadvantages               |

   | Turgor                      | Manage resources used to draw symbols, to live       | Economy strategy;<br>3D                   | Old game;<br>Too “innovative” |
