# **Introduction**
## **Week 2 - Choosing the Tech Stack, Designing the Architecture**

{{< embed-pdf url="/capstone/Week2.pdf" >}}

Welcome to Week 2 of our project! This week holds immense value as we delve into two critical aspects that will shape the trajectory of our software solution: selecting the appropriate tech stack and designing a robust architecture.

Choosing the right tech stack is essential for the success of our project. It empowers us to leverage the most suitable technologies, frameworks, and programming languages that align with our objectives and the expertise of our team members. By carefully evaluating scalability, performance, security, and development efficiency, we can ensure that our chosen tech stack provides a solid foundation for the development process.

Equally important is designing an architecture that not only meets our current requirements but also supports the long-term vision of our software solution. A well-thought-out architecture forms the backbone of our application, providing scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. This week, we will focus on defining the architecture by considering the component breakdown, data management, user interface design, integration with external systems, scalability, security, error handling, and deployment strategies.

As we proceed with these crucial tasks, let us bear in mind that the decisions we make in Week 2 will significantly impact our project's trajectory. Thoughtful consideration, collaboration, and thorough planning will pave the way for a successful and impactful software solution. Remember, we have a remarkable opportunity to demonstrate our skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities as we craft a solution that surpasses expectations.

Throughout Week 2, we encourage open communication, sharing of ideas, and active collaboration within the team. Embrace this chance to learn from each other, leverage diverse perspectives, and foster an environment of innovation. Let us approach Week 2 with enthusiasm, dedication, and a shared commitment to creating a software solution that not only meets our project goals but also leaves a lasting impact in the domain we are targeting.


### **Tech Stack Selection**

Choosing the right tech stack is paramount for the smooth execution of your project. Evaluate the requirements and objectives of your project to determine the most suitable technologies, frameworks, and programming languages to employ. Consider factors such as scalability, performance, security, and the expertise of your team members.

Take this opportunity to research and discuss potential tech stack options within your team. Aim for a well-rounded combination of tools that align with your project's objectives and the skill sets of your team members. Remember, the chosen tech stack should empower you to deliver a high-quality solution while efficiently addressing the project's requirements.

### **Architecture Design**

Designing a robust and scalable architecture is crucial for the long-term success and maintainability of your software project. This week, focus on defining the architecture that will serve as the backbone of your application. Consider the following aspects:

1. **Component Breakdown**: Identify the major components and modules that will form your software solution. Outline their responsibilities and interactions to ensure a cohesive structure.

2. **Data Management**: Determine how data will be stored, accessed, and manipulated within your application. Select appropriate databases or data storage solutions based on the project's requirements.

3. **User Interface (UI) Design**: Consider the user experience (UX) and design principles when planning your UI. Sketch wireframes or create mockups to visualize the layout and flow of your application.

4. **Integration and APIs**: Assess any external systems, services, or APIs that need to be integrated into your application. Plan how these integrations will be implemented and how data will flow between systems.

5. **Scalability and Performance**: Anticipate future growth and consider scalability aspects when designing the architecture. Ensure that your application can handle increasing user loads and data volumes without compromising performance.

6. **Security and Privacy**: Incorporate appropriate security measures into your architecture to protect user data and safeguard against potential vulnerabilities. Consider authentication, authorization, encryption, and other relevant security practices.

7. **Error Handling and Resilience**: Plan for handling errors and exceptions to maintain a reliable and resilient application. Define strategies for error logging, monitoring, and graceful error recovery.

8. **Deployment and DevOps**: Consider the deployment process and DevOps practices that align with your chosen tech stack. Automate deployment tasks, implement version control, and establish a robust development workflow.

Remember, your architecture design should be flexible enough to accommodate potential future changes or enhancements. Keep in mind the scalability, maintainability, and extensibility of your software solution.

Additionally, we expect that you will **cover all mentioned** topics above in your weekly progress report.

## **Week 2 questionnaire:**  

1) Tech Stack Resources: Are you utilizing any **project-based books** that specifically cover your tech stack and help you build your project? If yes, please provide the names of these books (name at least 3). How do you anticipate utilizing these materials to enhance your knowledge and expertise in your tech stack?

2) Mentorship Support: Do you currently have a mentor actively involved in your project? If yes, kindly share the name of your mentor and explain how their guidance has positively influenced your project. If you don't have a mentor yet, have you considered seeking one? How do you believe having a mentor could contribute to the success of your project? Remember, having an experienced mentor that can guide you and your team is your responsibility.

3) Exploring Alternative Resources: In addition to project-based books, what other resources have you explored to expand your understanding of your tech stack? This could include online courses, video tutorials, documentation, or any other sources that have been valuable in filling knowledge gaps. Please, name at least 3 resources

4) Identifying Knowledge Gaps: Are there any specific areas within your tech stack where you or your team feel there are knowledge gaps or expertise is lacking? If so, how do you plan to address these gaps and ensure a well-rounded understanding of your chosen technologies? Please name the tech stack division in your team and outline how are you planning to deal with **knowledge gaps**

5) Engaging with the Tech Community: Have you actively engaged with the broader tech community to seek guidance or learn from experienced professionals in your tech stack? This could involve participating in online forums and groups (telegram, discord or any other platform), attending local meetups (Kazan, Innopolis)? Do you have means to engage experts into critical tech stack problems through professional networks?

6) Learning Objectives: What specific learning objectives have you set for yourself and your team in relation to your tech stack this week? How do you plan to achieve these objectives, and what strategies or resources will you employ to deepen your understanding?

7) Sharing Knowledge with Peers: How have you been sharing your knowledge and expertise with your teammates? Have you organized any knowledge-sharing sessions or discussions to facilitate the exchange of insights and experiences related to your tech stack?

8) How have you leveraged AI to compensate for any lacking expertise in your tech stack? Have you utilized AI-powered tools or platforms to expedite the process of acquiring knowledge and expertise in your tech stack?


### **Tech Stack and Team Allocation**

After finalizing the tech stack and team allocation, how did you ensure that each team member was effectively assigned to appropriate tasks and responsibilities within the project? Please provide a detailed explanation of how your project is structured, including the specific technologies being utilized and the corresponding team members responsible for each component. **Clearly outline the responsibilities of each team member in relation to their assigned parts**.
