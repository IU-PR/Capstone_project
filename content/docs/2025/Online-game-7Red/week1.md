## Brainstorming

### Ideas during brainstorming

1) **Multiplayer 7Red (Card Game)** – An online version of the Russian  game "7Red" with statistics, achievements and private rooms for friends. 

2) **Digital Menu & Order System for Happiness** – A lightweight web app for cafés to manage pickup orders, with real-time kitchen updates, SMS notifications, and prep time estimates. (Note: The "Happiness" café said they don’t need it)

3) **Dorm Room Swap Platform** – A matchmaking system for students to trade dorm rooms based on preferences like floor/campus or roommate compatibility (Note: already exists in our dorm).

4) **Smart Moving Checklist Generator** – A web app that creates personalized packing lists based on room size, distance, and season, integrating with Google Keep/Todoist for tracking (Note: though AI can do this now).
