# **Week #1**

## Project description

### Project name: *Total control*

**Code repository**: https://https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/total_control

The Robotics Laboratory of Innopolis University and the Control Theory course faced the need to train students on real physical installations to hone their skills in developing control algorithms. Thanks to this, students will be able to take into account all the features of the real world, as well as quickly test their solutions without having troubles with hardware.

The Cart Pole system, also known as an inverted pendulum, is a control problem, where a pole is mounted on a wheeled cart that moves along a one-dimensional track. The goal is to control the movement of a cart such that the pole stays balanced around its vertical axis. The system is nonlinear and unstable, making it an excellent base for control theory, reinforcement learning and robotics.

The objective is to design a software and hardware product for the robotics laboratory of Innopolis University in order to study and improve skills in the field of Control Theory, Reinforcement Learning (RL), Shapers and other areas of Modern Robotics. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to solve the following tasks:
- Check the operability of the existing stand as a whole and its elements separately
- Develop and prepare the power supply and wiring of the system and connect it to the controller
- Develop low-level algorithms for managing components, with a particular focus on the physical limitations of the components to prevent damage to the structure, environment, and students.
- Develop a library in the Peyton language that provides interfaces and classes with a high level of abstraction for easy connection and management of the laboratory stand via the serial port

### Brief market research / problem validation

While a mechanism is readily available on the market, it remains difficult to find a programmer capable of developing the necessary software for the laboratory setup. Currently, there are no publicly accessible programs that meet our specific requirements. This perspective is shared by professionals in the field and staff at the Innopolis Institute of Robotics. Therefore, our solution not only addresses this gap but also holds significant importance for student practice, providing them with valuable hands-on experience in a practical setting.

## Basic requirements

### Target users and their primary needs

The Cart Pole system serves as a versatile platform for control theory, robotics, and machine learning. It addresses the educational, research, and prototyping needs of a wide range of users. Below is a categorized list of key target users along with their primary motivations and use cases.

1. **University Students (Engineering/Robotics)**

Primary Needs:
- Understand real-world implementation of control algorithms.
- Perform hands-on experiments to complement theoretical coursework.
- Analyze system dynamics through physical modeling and simulation.

Use Case:
Students use the system during labs and final year projects to apply PID, LQR, and state estimation techniques.

2. **Professors and Lab Instructors**

Primary Needs:
- Provide safe, reliable, and repeatable lab experiments.
- Teach core concepts in control systems, feedback, and signal processing.
- Easily reset and monitor the system during student use.

Use Case:
Faculty integrate the cart-pole into structured lab modules or capstone projects for teaching applied control theory.

3. **AI/ML Researchers**

Primary Needs:
- Test reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms on real-world dynamic systems.
- Collect noisy, physical-world data to validate simulation results.
- Bridge the sim-to-real gap for policy transfer.
