## 🧠 **Brainstorming**

### 💡 **Ideas during brainstorming**

1. **KIZAK AI Career Coach** (Selected) - Comprehensive learning and career guidance platform
2. AI Concept Assistant - AI powered application for inspecting
3. Smart Interview Simulator - Real-time technical interview practice tool
4. Project-Based Learning Platform - Curated project roadmaps for different tech stacks

### 📊 **Brief market research / problem validation**

We analyzed 4 comparable projects:

1. **AI Career Coach by redjules** [(GitHub)](https://github.com/redjules/ai-career-coach) - Good for interview prep but requires technical setup
2. **FutureFit AI** [(Website)](https://www.futurefit.ai/) - Strong market data but enterprise-focused
3. **LearningPath.ai** [(Website)](https://learningpath.ai/) - Excellent for Data/AI but narrow in scope
4. **AI Personalized Learning Platform by HemantKumar01** [(GitHub)](https://github.com/HemantKumar01/AIPersonalizedLearningPlatform) - Simple roadmaps but lacks advanced features

**Key insight:** Existing solutions are either too narrow or too complex, creating a need for an integrated, user-friendly platform.
