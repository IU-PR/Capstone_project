### **Value Proposition**

- Identify the Problem:
Our software project addresses the need for more personalized digital communication. As interactions with AI and chatbots become increasingly common in both personal and professional settings, many users find that these interactions often feel generic and impersonal. This lack of personalization can reduce user satisfaction and engagement.

- Solution Description:
Our chatbot models will be capable of imitating the communication style of specific individuals, personalization through uploaded chat histories. Users can easily upload their conversations with a specific person, enabling the bot to learn and mimic that person’s communication style. This will allow the users to feel more engaged with chatbots.

- Benefits to Users:
The users of these chatbots will be more engaged in conversation. This key point is important as the users will have more positive communication experience overall. Moreover, these chatbots, if used in commercial applications, can produce more income to the company as the clients will have a better experience using the company's software.

- Differentiation:
Our chat-bot is designed to imitate an individual’s unique communication style with high precision, capturing nuances in language, tone, and context. This creates a more authentic and engaging user experience. The existing solutions usually do not provide chat-bots able to imitate other's communication styles, leading to poorer user experience. Our solution provides highly customizable chat-bots that will be able to adapt to one's communication style using his\her chat history.  

- User Impact:
By mimicing specific individuals, the chatbot can provide a highly personalized user experience. This can enhance engagement and satisfaction in customer service, social media interactions, and personal messaging platforms. Moreover, chatbots can handle routine queries in customer service, freeing human agents to tackle more complex issues. This can lead to a higher overall efficiency of chat-bots.

- Use Cases:
1. __Scenario__: An online language learning platform incorporates MetaMoprphGPT to simulate conversations with native speakers.\
__Outcome__: Students practice with the chatbot, which mimics native speakers' styles, enhancing their conversational skills and confidence in using the language.

2. __Scenario__: An online banking platform may introduce MetaMorphGPT to make their assistant chatbot feel more user-frienldy to users.\
__Outcome__: Customets and users of the online banking platform will be more engaged with the assistant. This will lead to a more positive user experience.


## **Lean Questionnaire**

Please answer the following questions related to the lean methodology:

1. What problem or need does your software project address? 
   
   Our software project resolves the issue of disengaging and generic AI chat-bots. Our solution will provide the natural language processing model that will allow users to train their own model on a specific user's chat history. The trained model will imitate the specific user's communication style. 

2. Who are your target users or customers?

   Our target customers are companies that enable AI chat-bots to provide the best possible user experience to their clients. Our solution will improve the user experience even further by making the chat-bot's communication style more engaging and authentic.

3. How will you validate and test your assumptions about the project?

   To validate the assumptions about the project we will run an experiment to test and compare the user experiences with the generic chat-bots and chat-bots created by MetaMorphGPT.

4. What metrics will you use to measure the success of your project?

   To measure the success of the project we will measure the user satisfaction, user engagement and overall user impression of our chatbots. Then, we will compare the results - the difference between user experiences when using generic chat-bots and when using MetaMorphGPT. 

5. How do you plan to iterate and pivot if necessary based on user feedback?

   Based on the user feedback we will be able to identify any problems that occur when using MetaMorphGPT. We will be able to introduce any changes and tackle any problems.

## **Leveraging AI, Open-Source, and Experts**

Our team will leverage Artificial Intelligence practices to create chat-bots that are able to imitate specific person's communication style. Natural Language Processing models will train on user's chat hitory.

## **Defining the Vision for Your Project**

- Overview: Our software project aims to create a chat-bot that can accurately imitate an individual's communication style based on their chat history. The purpose of this project is to enhance the personalization and authenticity of automated interactions across various domains, such as customer service, personal assistants, and social communications.
