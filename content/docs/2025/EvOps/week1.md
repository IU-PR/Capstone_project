# Week #1

## Project Description

- **Name**: EvOps üê≥
- **Code repository**: https://github.com/IU-Capstone-Project-2025/evops

### Motivation

It is 2025, there are many sources of information. Telegram chats, email
notifications, real-life announcements‚Äîeverything wants your attention\! Because
of this option hell, people get lost and frustrated. In short, ‚Äúmany info bad.‚Äù
That‚Äôs why we decided to create a new app to rule them all\!

### Description

**EvOps** is a self-hosted platform to share and discover local events (e.g.
performances, parties, or study sessions). You can think of it as a full-stack
alternative to the ‚ÄúOpportunities For You‚Äù Telegram channel (which it may
actually become).

Our main goal for now is to integrate into the university ecosystem. If
everything goes well, we may even go beyond and allow anyone to launch their own
instance of EvOps.

## Brainstorming

### Ideas During Brainstorming

1. A type-safe i18n framework with code generation.

   The concept is similar to Paraglide JS. The main difference is that we wanted
   to build an app not restricted to JavaScript only. This project would have
   high value since there are no alternatives that offer the same functionality.
   However, it requires a very narrow set of skills and doesn‚Äôt seem suitable
   for a team project.

2. Yet another educational platform with fancy visualization of computer science
   concepts.

   The idea arose when reading Tanenbaum‚Äôs Modern Operating Systems book. The
   lack of visualization and interaction made understanding fundamental concepts
   complicated. However, we did not want to implement this project because
   education and AI are overrated nowadays. üëπ

3. Finally, today‚Äôs star‚Äîan event aggregator.

   We settled on this idea because (1) this project has easy to understand and
   implement requirements, (2) it incorporates different skills. We decided to
   take on this idea and make the best out of it. Besides, there is a need for
   such a service in our university, so we can already research requirements of
   our first potential client and try to meet them in our product.

### Market Research

#### Conclusion

The comparison table shows the gap in existing solutions. There is no
easy-to-use open source, self-hosted system, that provides all the needed
functionality.

## Basic Requirements

### Target Users and Their Primary Needs

Since our main priority is to integrate into our university‚Äôs ecosystem, the
requirements are defined with respect to the administration‚Äôs (319 üëã) requests.
Here, we‚Äôve split our users into several groups and tried to identify their
needs:

- Event viewers (e.g. students)
  - Smart recommendation system
  - Convenient UX / responsiveness
- Event organizers (e.g. club leads, active students, administration)
  - Rich tools for creating events
  - Collecting attenders for an event
- Moderators (e.g. administration, trusted people)
  - Reviewing events to be published
- Hosters (e.g. our university)
  - Ease of hosting
  - Configurability
  - Maintainability

### User Stories

- Event viewers (student):
  - **Discover Events:** as a student, I want to see upcoming events relevant to
    my interests (e.g., CS workshops, basketball games), so that I don‚Äôt miss
    opportunities.
  - **One-Click Registration:** as a busy student, I want to discover events in
    one click, so that I can quickly register for events without logging into
    multiple platforms.
- Event organizer:
  - **Simple Event Creation:** as an event organizer, I want to create an event
    with title, date, location, description, and tags, so I can share it in less
    than five minutes.
  - **Event Tracking:** as an event organizer, I want to see in real time the
    number of attendees, so I can plan my resources.
  - **Event Updates:** as an event organizer, I want to notify all potential
    attendees if an event is cancelled or updated, so everyone will know only
    relevant information.
- Moderators:
  - **Content Moderation:** as an admin, I want to review inappropriate events
    and ban abusive users, so the platform stays safe and spam-free.
  - **User Role Permissions:** as an admin, I want to assign roles to club
    leaders, so only trusted accounts can post events as clubs.

### Initial Scope

Based on our current vision for the project, we want to see the following core
features:

- Account management.
- CRUD operations on events.
- Feed with existing events with a recommendation system.
- Convenient event editor.
- Search system with filters.
- Admin dashboard.
- Cross-platform support.

## Tech Stack

Below are listed the main technologies we are going to use in our project.\
We could say that the main criteria we valued were scalability, performance,
maturity, and other nice things, (which isn‚Äôt false to be fair), but being
honest, our tech stack has mainly been justified by our experience and personal
preferences. We‚Äôre only students, after all\!

### Back End

- **PyTorch**: deep learning framework used to build and train neural networks.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: library providing powerful, ready-to-use
  versions of BERT and other advanced AI models (transformers).
- **SentenceTransformers**: library for creating embeddings (vector
  representations) for whole sentences.
- **scikit-learn**: toolkit for measuring model performance (metrics) and using
  standard (‚Äúclassical‚Äù) machine learning algorithms.
- **pandas/numpy**: essential libraries for working with data and doing math
  operations.
- **Jupyter**: interactive notebooks for code experiments and sharing results.

### Android

- **Kotlin**: primary programming language.
- **Jetpack Compose**: UI toolkit.
- **Room**: library for local data storage using SQLite.
- **Dagger Hilt**: dependency Injection (DI) framework.
- **Retrofit**: type-safe HTTP client for REST API communication.

### Website

- **TypeScript**: primary programming language, JavaScript‚Äôs best version (no
  discussion).
- **Next.js**: full-stack meta framework to build web apps.
- **pnpm**: package manager, the fastest npm replacement.
- **Tailwind CSS**: battle tested CSS framework to style the application.
- **Element UI**: UI library for desktop web apps.
- **ConnectRPC**: library for client-server gRPC communication.

### DevOps

- **Docker Compose**: industry standard for orchestrating containers.
- **GitHub Actions**: automated CI/CD.

#### Potentially:

- **Prometheus**: hardware metrics and monitoring.
- **Grafana**: visualization dashboard that works well with Prometheus.
- **Kubernetes**: container orchestration platform.

#### Ramil Shakirzyanov and Maksim Ilin

The ML team discussed the project‚Äôs solution designs and the ways of measuring
their efficiency.

**Proposed Ideas**

1. **Automatic Tag Extraction**
   - **Goal**: Get a preliminary list of tags for application events
   - **How**: Load and preprocess messages from the Telegram channel
     ‚ÄúOpportunities For You.‚Äù Send them to a language model to retrieve post
     topics. Finally, manually choose the preliminary set of tags.

2. **Automatic Post Classification**
   - **Goal**: Automatically tag posts within the application.
   - **How**: When a user creates a post in the application, send the post
     description _and_ the preliminary tag set to a language model. The model
     will assign the most suitable multiple tags.

3. **Post Recommendation System:**
   - **Goal**: Recommend relevant posts to users.
   - **How**:
     - Build user ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù profiles using metadata (for example, emoji
       reactions to posts in the application, comments left, etc.) as a weighted
       sum of the vector representations of the corresponding posts.
     - For each post the user hasn‚Äôt seen and that is still relevant, calculate
       its ‚Äúscore‚Äù using a formula.
     - Recommend posts with the highest scores.
   - **Notes:**
     - A post is ‚Äúunseen‚Äù if the user hasn‚Äôt reacted to it with an emoji.
     - ‚ÄúRelevant‚Äù means the event isn‚Äôt over when we make recommendations.
     - This formula is subject to change.

**Measuring Effectiveness**

- **For Automatic Tag Extraction and Automatic Post Classification:**
  - We will verify how well the tags align with the meaning of a sample of posts
    taken from the ‚ÄúOpportunities For You‚Äù Telegram channel, logically.
- **For the Post Recommendation System:**
  - We‚Äôll give access to the Application to a test group (inside and probably
    outside the team).
  - Each person will focus more on a pre-agreed set of events.
  - We will assess how well the recommended posts align with the types of events
    people view.

## Confirmation of the Code‚Äôs Operability

We confirm that the code in the `main` branch:

- [x] Is in a working condition.
- [x] Runs via Docker Compose.
